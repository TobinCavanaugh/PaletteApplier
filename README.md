# PaletteApplier

A super basic palette applier with support for .pal files and pngs.
I made this on a whim, while procrastinating more important work, i think its a pretty cool afternoon project though, and was a good exercise of my learning skills.
This was my first time using C# windows forms, and I learned alot from this project.
I think the largest limitation of this program is that it works best for use with pixel art, as it was not designed for high resolution image processing.
Maybe I'll revisit this with a GPU in the future!

It does best with low bit color palettes and pixel art images, however you can get pretty decently high images processed in a few seconds, though again, its not what this program was made for.
